# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### This project will take a persons age in years and run a series of methods to figure out different statistics about the user based off of their age.  Example statistics are their age in seconds on planet earth and on other planets, and it will compare the users age to another age to find the difference in time. 04/20/2018

## Description

This application will determine a users age on various planets based on solar years.  Users will be able to input a their age in years and find out how many seconds old they are, as well as their age in Mercury years, Venus years, Mars years, Jupiter years.  It will tell them how many years they have left on each planet based off of their age expectancy.
